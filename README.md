Hello coder buddy,

To run this weather app , all you need is to login into "OpenWeatherMap".
Go to "My Api Keys" section under your profile
copy that "key"(make sure it is activated) from there.
create .env file in root of this project( after forking it)
paste that key into .env file as-
VITE_OPEN_WEATHER_API=key

After setting up the .env,restart/run the app using command 
npm run dev in terminal(make sure you are in right folder)

*Make sure to run (npm install) to add all the node_modules after forking*
